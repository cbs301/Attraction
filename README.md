# Attraction
This is a site on how the law of attraction is helping me.

I just recently learned about the Law of Attraction. I was browsing **Netflix** and found a video on the Law of Attraction. "What is this?", I wondered. What it was is a video that was life changing.

# What is the Law of Attraction


The *Law of Attraction* is a fundamental law that is defined as follows:
> Whatever you think about is attracted to you.

Now think about that. This means if you think negitively about something, than more negitivity is coming your way. However, the best part is this. If you think positively about something, more positivity is coming your way.
